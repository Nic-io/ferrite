#+TITLE: Ferrite
#+STARTUP: A cortex M4 Baremetal startup project


The aim of this project -on top of serving as an exercise- is to have a minimal platfom to test and
optimize chunks of codes that would be used in feature rich projects.

It's also a nice to have for quick fiddling on new targets

*   To build and launch emulation run:

#+BEGIN_SRC Shell
make qemu

make run
#+END_SRC

Then within the qemu terminal you can run a gdb-server

*   To build for Nucleo run:

#+BEGIN_SRC Shell
make stm32f4
#+END_SRC
